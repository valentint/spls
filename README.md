The package `spls` Provides functions for fitting a sparse partial least
squares (SPLS) regression and classification (Chun and Keles (2010)
<doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2009.00723.x>).

## Installation

The `spls` package is on CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network) and
the latest release can be easily installed using the command

    install.packages("spls")
    library(spls)

## Building from source

To install the latest stable development version from GitHub, you can
pull this repository and install it using

    ## install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_github("valentint/spls", build_opts = c("--no-build-vignettes"))

Of course, if you have already installed `remotes`, you can skip the
first line (I have commented it out).
